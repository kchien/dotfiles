#
#Usage
#
#1. <prefix> [ to start “copy-mode” (Not sure what <prefix> is? This post can help)
#2. Move to the text you want to copy using Vim-like key bindings, i.e., k to move up a line, / to search, etc.
#3. v to start selection
#4. Move to end of text with Vim key-bindings. The selection will be highlighted
#5. y to copy the highlighted/selected text
#
#The selected text is now in your clipboard, and your day is that much better for it.
#--------
# Use vim keybindings in copy mode
setw -g mode-keys vi

# # Setup 'v' to begin selection as in Vim
bind-key -t vi-copy v begin-selection
bind-key -t vi-copy y copy-pipe "reattach-to-user-namespace pbcopy"

# # Update default binding of `Enter` to also use copy-pipe
unbind -t vi-copy Enter
bind-key -t vi-copy Enter copy-pipe "reattach-to-user-namespace pbcopy"
